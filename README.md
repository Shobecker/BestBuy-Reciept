Date of Sale
Itemized Purchases
Total Sale (without sales tax)
Amount Due (with added sales tax)


Dynamically-Added Items
Tax Computation object (based on state that store residing in)
Optional Secondary Heading, e.g.,
− “Happy Holidays from Best Buy”
− “Summer Sales are Hot at Best Buy”
Optional Items printed at the end of the receipt:
− Relevant Rebate Forms
− Promotional Coupons (e.g., “10% off next purchase”)
